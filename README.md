# ECSE6680-VLSI-Course-Project
This project is divided into 4 steps:
FIR low pass filter:
1. MATLAB generation of COE files for fir filter coefficients and signal generator
2. generate fir IP core and ROM IP core (vivado)
3. write top-level .v file to exemplify fir and ROM
4. perform top-level engineering simulations
